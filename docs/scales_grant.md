# SCALES

## Can you look those over and tell me

- Whether you are like "Yes or No."
- Whether these make sense to get?

For a lot of these, we just need subsamples - like a test dataset of 1000 records

1. How many records that could be georeferenced lack them for angiosperms on GBIF?
1. What percent of angiosperm records on GBIF is missing one or more field either from the Darwin Core core fields or from extended specimen fields that could be captured?
2. What percent of angiosperm records on GBIF have an issue in a core field - either a mistake (a wrong date) or incomplete report e.g. the locality field is not the full locality.
3. What percent of bird records have one or more traits or other extended specimen data that could be extracted from that record?
